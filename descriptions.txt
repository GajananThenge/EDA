Statsistcs:

1. Descriptive  : Gives understanding about data like its spread,median etc
				To get quick data summary
				describe() function gives a good picture of distribution of data.
				
				
				
				ANOVA
				ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance. It is performed to figure out the relation 
				between the different group of categorical data.
				
				
				
				
2. Inferentials :  Useful in hypothesis testing









EDA:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial component of data science which allows 
you to develop the gist of what your data look like and what kinds of questions might be answered by them.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used on the one hand to answer questions, test business assumptions, 
generate hypotheses for further analysis. On the other hand, you can also use it to prepare the data for modeling.

One of the things that you’ll often see when you’re reading about EDA is Data profiling. Data profiling is 
concerned with summarizing your dataset through descriptive statistics


1. To get better understanding of data
2. Identifying important features (RF can be used/Domain Knowledge)
3. Identifying relatuonship between them



Boxplot:a pictorial representation of distribution of data which 
				shows extreme values,median and quartiles
				We can easily figure out outliers by using boxplots
